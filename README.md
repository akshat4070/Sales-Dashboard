Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop and maintain a dynamic sales dashboard that facilitates data-driven decision-making for sales and marketing teams. The dashboard offers clear visualizations and actionable insights derived from the analysis of sales data. The primary focus is on tracking KPIs, understanding sales trends, identifying areas for improvement, and maximizing profitability.
This repository hosts a comprehensive sales dashboard developed in Power BI, providing insights and analytics on various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales data. The dashboard covers metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, average delivery days, and the number of returned orders. Additionally, it offers detailed analyses on sales performance by segment, region-wise sales distribution, top 10 customers, as well as identification of the top 5 most profitable and top 5 loss-making products.
